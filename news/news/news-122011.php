|2|1324488072|1|Elemovements|In the Studio|Hello, fellow human (as you seem). We have been recording tunes over the past week in the studio of Mr. Nate Robbins, a great musician and sound engineer out of Oxford. The process is coming along nicely and rather quickly considering the amount of original material we are laying down and listening to (ourselves) for the first time. <br /><br />We cherish your continued support and can't wait to get some finished tunes out as soon as we can!||SAVE:|1|1324488072|1324689635|gabriel|<
