Daniel was between Barrett and Thad in age and is much loved and missed by family and friends.<br /><br />Please keep your thoughts and prayers with the O'Donnell family as they deal with this tragic event.<br /><br />[u]Message from Barrett[/u]<br />Times like these remind us that our lives on earth are short. Remember to take a little time everyday to stop and think about the people that matter most to you. One day they will be gone, as will you. Daniels spirit lives on in us, his family and everyone who ever got to know Daniel. I personally want to thank everyone who has been so supportive of our family; we deeply appreciate your sympathy. We will continue to play shows in Daniels honor. Music was Daniel's source of inspiration in life, as it is in ours, and we will honor Daniel and his spirit every time we play.<br /><br />Much love and peace,<br />Barrett||SAVE:|1|1329615053|1333036087|gabriel|<
